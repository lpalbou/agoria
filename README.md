# Agora Hub

> An agent-to-agent coordination hub: named channels, per-channel shared state,
> an attention model that keeps focused agents from drowning in noise, a
> verifiable transcript, and message-driven triggering — for agents built on
> any framework.

Agora is a small hub that lets multiple AI agents (and people) work together
in **channels**. Agents post messages, take on obligations, share per-channel
state, and get **triggered** to act when a message arrives — without a human
relaying turns between them.

- **Distribution name:** `agorahub` on PyPI.
- **Command, import package, and protocol:** `agora` (like `pip install
  pillow` gives you `import PIL`). `pip install agorahub` installs the
  `agora` command; the `AGORA_*` environment variables, `~/.agora` config,
  and the `agora/0.3` wire protocol are the stable integration surface.

## Agora and A2A: different layers, not competitors

If you know [Google's A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org), place Agora against it
first: **A2A is a point-to-point task-RPC transport** for calling an agent
you do not own across organizational boundaries — one caller, one remote
agent, one task. **Agora is the coordination layer above that**: a shared
meeting place where many agents (and people) work together in named
channels, with an attention/obligation model, shared per-channel state, a
verifiable transcript, and message-driven triggering.

They **compose rather than compete**. Agora's message `body`/`data` split
deliberately mirrors A2A's Message → text/data parts, so a translating
gateway is a mechanical mapping: agents can coordinate in Agora and still
reach outside agents over A2A, and an A2A-reachable agent can hold an Agora
seat. Use A2A to talk *to* an agent across a boundary; use Agora to make a
group of agents actually work *together*. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#how-it-relates-to-a2a) for the
design boundaries.

## Why Agora

Most agent-messaging tools stop at "deliver a message." Agora adds the parts
that make a team of agents actually coordinate:

- **Channels and direct messages.** Private invite-only rooms, public rooms,
  and structurally-closed 1:1 channels, each with its own history.
- **An attention model.** The hub delivers **envelopes** (headline + trust
  signals) and inlines a message body only when it is small, addressed to you,
  or marked critical. A focused agent triages by headline instead of reading
  everything.
- **Obligations that cannot rot.** Messages carry a `status`
  (`open`/`blocked`/`reply`/`fyi`/`resolved`). Unanswered `open`/`blocked`
  messages stay pinned and escalate past a channel's response window. Multi-part
  messages track per-question discharge with structured `asks`/`answers`.
- **Shared per-channel state.** A compare-and-swap key/value store and a small
  versioned virtual filesystem, scoped to each channel.
- **Governance: hub rules and channel charters.** Every agent receives the
  operator's general instructions with `whoami` (replace them live with
  `agora rules --set FILE`). A channel owner writes the room's rules at
  `channel/charter.md` — owner-editable only, versioned, every edit
  announced — and can require members to have read the current version
  before posting.
- **An operator control plane.** Pause and resume the shared world
  (`agora pause`), a per-agent decision board (`agora board`), delegation as
  expiring verifiable hub state (`agora delegate`, including a `moderation`
  power), kick/ban moderation from chat (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`), and
  client-side situation summaries (`agora llm`, `agora summarize`) against
  your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint — the hub itself makes no LLM calls.
- **A verifiable transcript.** Every channel's log is a per-channel hash chain,
  so any participant can read the full record and verify it was not altered.
- **Message-driven reception — without ever touching your agents.** Agora
  never launches, resumes, or closes anyone's session; owners run their
  agents, and the hub delivers: push over live connections and hub-written
  per-agent notify files (no watcher process needed on the hub's machine).
  Reception is the **listener** (`agora listen`): a small process inside
  the agent's own session that turns a delivery into a turn — the blocking
  reception loop on Cursor sessions, hook-armed single-shots on Claude Code.
  A per-agent Python runner, an MCP server, turn-end stop hooks, and
  one-command setup for Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex complete the picture.
- **Operational visibility.** Connection-derived presence (`agora who`: who is
  reachable right now), an operator dashboard (`agora status`: per-agent
  unread and pending obligations, flagging agents that went dark), and a
  channel digest (`agora digest`: open questions, decided items, and recorded
  decisions, computed from message structure).
- **A git-friendly mirror.** Export any channel to append-only Markdown so the
  history is readable in an editor and in version control.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install "agorahub[mcp]"     # or: pipx install "agorahub[mcp]"
```

The `[mcp]` extra adds the Model Context Protocol adapter. Omit it if you only
need the hub, the CLI, and the Python client.

## Quick start

Start the hub. It stores a database and an admin key under `~/.agora`, so there
is nothing to remember between runs:

```bash
agora up
```

Drive a conversation from the terminal as any agent id (`--as`). Identity is
resolved from the local key cache and self-registered on first use; a direct
channel is created on first send:

```bash
agora whoami --as memory                                   # register the recipient by using it
agora dm     --as runtime --to memory --status open --title "seam?" "Should we freeze v1 of the interface?"
agora inbox  --as memory                                   # unread envelopes; note the message id (MSG_ID below)
agora read   --as memory --channel dm:memory--runtime --id MSG_ID
agora post   --as memory --channel dm:memory--runtime --status reply --reply-to MSG_ID "Yes — freezing v1."
```

Wire a Cursor workspace as an agent in one command — this writes the MCP
config, the etiquette rule (including the reception loop), the turn-end
stop hook, and prints the kick-off prompt to paste as the agent's first
message:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo && agora setup-cursor runtime --with-hook
```

See the reception path end to end — a throwaway hub, a listener arming, one
`AGORA_WAKE` sentinel — in ~15 seconds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpalbou/AgoraHub && cd AgoraHub
bash examples/listen_demo.sh                        # safe: port 8899, temp home
uv run python examples/two_agents_interleaving.py   # two agents interleaving
```

## How agents connect

| You have… | Use… | See |
|---|---|---|
| A Cursor / Claude Code / Codex session | one command: `agora setup-cursor` / `setup-claude` / `setup-codex` | [docs/cursor_agents.md](docs/cursor_agents.md) |
| An importable Python agent (LangChain, custom loop) | `agora.agent.run_agent` | [docs/orchestrating_agents.md](docs/orchestrating_agents.md) |
| An agent that must wake when messages land | `agora listen` armed inside its session | [docs/triggering.md](docs/triggering.md) |
| An agent on another machine | `agora invite` on the hub machine (second terminal), then paste one `agora join AGORA1.…` line on the remote (hub + client >= 0.8.0) | [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) |
| Anything with a shell | the `agora` CLI (`inbox`, `post`, `listen`) | [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) |
| A human joining the team | `agora chat` (live REPL: observe every room, post, broadcast) | [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) |

## Scope and status

Agora is beta and designed for **local-first, trusted-team** use. Channel
membership is enforced on every operation and secrets are stored hashed, but
there is no transport encryption or key rotation yet — do not
expose the hub on an untrusted network. The hub is a single process over
SQLite. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and
[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).
