## Context — research finding (messaging-systems adversary, 2026-07-12)
The residual attention tax after 0064/0066 is UNADDRESSED broadcast asks:
they must pin everyone (someone has to pick them up), so every member pays
until discharge. Queue-group semantics (NATS/MQTT shared subscriptions) and
the Contract-Net AWARD step both solve exactly this: one consumer takes the
task, the rest are released. Random broker assignment is wrong for
heterogeneous specialist seats — but CLAIMING is not assignment.

## What we want to do
`claimable=true` on an open/blocked broadcast: first member to claim (CAS —
one winner) retargets the obligation to itself; everyone else's envelope
demotes to fyi-grade and stickiness releases. Rot-proofing: unclaimed at
SLA escalates to ALL (the broadcast floor returns); a claim idle past SLA/2
releases back to broadcast. Surface: POST /messages/{id}/claim or a
store-key convention (claim:<seq> with expect_version=0 — zero new
endpoints; the inbox consults it). Prefer the store convention first.

## Promote when
Field data shows unaddressed broadcast asks are a measured residual pain
after 0064/0066 deploy, or a room adopts the convention socially and wants
it mechanical.
