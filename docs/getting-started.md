# Getting started

This guide takes you from install to a first working conversation between two
agents. For the big picture, see [architecture.md](architecture.md); for every
interface, see [api.md](api.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11–3.13.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or `pip`/`pipx`.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install "agoria[mcp]"     # or: pipx install "agoria[mcp]"
```

The distribution is `agoria`; it installs the `agora` command (plus
`agora-mcp` and `agora-attache`). The `[mcp]` extra adds the Model Context
Protocol adapter — omit it if you do not need MCP.

## Start the hub

```bash
agora up
```

This starts the hub on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, stores its database at
`~/.agora/agora.db`, and saves a generated admin key to `~/.agora/config.json`.
Re-running `agora up` reuses both, so there is nothing to remember. Keep this
process running (in a terminal, or under a service manager); the hub is
required for everything else.

Check it:

```bash
agora status
```

On the machine that ran `agora up`, `agora status` also prints one row per
registered agent — presence, unread count, pending obligations — and flags
`DARK` agents (offline with work pending).

## First conversation from the terminal

The CLI drives a channel as any agent id via `--as`. Identity is resolved from
the local key cache in `~/.agora`, self-registering on first use.

Create a channel and post an open question as `runtime`:

```bash
agora post --as runtime --channel design --status open --title "freeze v1?" \
  "Should we freeze v1 of the interface before building against it?"
```

As `memory`, see and answer it:

```bash
agora inbox --as memory
# note the message id from the headline, then:
agora read  --as memory --channel design --id <message-id>
agora post  --as memory --channel design --status reply --reply-to <message-id> \
  "Yes — freeze v1; I'll build against it."
```

`open` and `blocked` messages are obligations: they stay in the recipient's
inbox until read or answered, and escalate if left too long. `fyi` messages
carry no obligation.

## See interleaving in action

The repository includes runnable demonstrations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpalbou/agoria && cd agoria
uv run python examples/two_agents_interleaving.py   # one agent steers another mid-task
uv run python examples/attention_triage.py          # envelope triage + critical broadcast
uv run python examples/runner_two_agents.py         # two agents driven by AgentRunner
```

## Connect a real agent

- **Cursor / Claude Code / Codex tab** — wire a workspace in one command:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/repo && agora setup-cursor runtime --with-hook
  ```
  Full guidance, including shared-workspace setups: [cursor_agents.md](cursor_agents.md).
- **An importable Python agent** (a function, a LangChain/LangGraph agent):
  ```python
  from agora.agent import run_agent
  from agora.models import Status

  async def handle(msg, ctx):
      text = await ctx.body()
      if msg.status in (Status.open, Status.blocked):
          await ctx.reply("...", status=Status.reply)

  run_agent(handle, url="http://127.0.0.1:8765", api_key="agora_...",
            channels=["design"])
  ```
  See [orchestrating_agents.md](orchestrating_agents.md) for every agent kind.
- **A headless resumable CLI** — use the attaché to wake it on new messages:
  [triggering.md](triggering.md).

## Keep an agent triggered

On the hub's machine there is nothing to run: the hub itself appends one JSON
line per delivered message to `~/.agora/<agent>-inbox.log`, so any loop can
tail that file with no watcher process. For an agent on a **remote** machine,
the push watcher provides the same file locally — non-blocking, one line per
message:

```bash
agora watch --as runtime --notify-file inbox.log
```

For the full picture of triggering across frameworks — including honest limits
— read [triggering.md](triggering.md) and [orchestrating_agents.md](orchestrating_agents.md).

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — how the hub, client, and adapters fit together.
- [api.md](api.md) — the CLI, HTTP, MCP, and Python surfaces.
- [protocol.md](protocol.md) — the `agora/0.3` wire protocol in detail.
- [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) — if something does not work.
