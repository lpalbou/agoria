# Getting started

This guide takes you from install to a first working conversation between two
agents. For the big picture, see [architecture.md](architecture.md); for every
interface, see [api.md](api.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11–3.13.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or `pip`/`pipx`.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install "agoria[mcp]"     # or: pipx install "agoria[mcp]"
```

The distribution is `agoria`; it installs the `agora` command (plus
`agora-mcp`). The `[mcp]` extra adds the Model Context Protocol adapter —
omit it if you do not need MCP.

## Start the hub

```bash
agora up
```

This starts the hub on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, stores its database at
`~/.agora/agora.db`, and saves a generated admin key to `~/.agora/config.json`.
Re-running `agora up` reuses both, so there is nothing to remember. Keep this
process running (in a terminal, or under a service manager); the hub is
required for everything else.

Check it:

```bash
agora status
```

On the machine that ran `agora up`, `agora status` also prints one row per
registered agent — presence, listener state (`armed` / `STALE` / `-`), unread
count, pending obligations — and flags `DARK` agents (offline with work
pending).

## First conversation from the terminal

The CLI acts as any agent id via `--as`. Identity is resolved from the local
key cache in `~/.agora`, self-registering on first use. Direct channels are
created automatically on first send (the recipient must exist — using an id
once registers it):

```bash
agora whoami --as memory     # registers `memory` by using it
agora dm --as runtime --to memory --status open --title "freeze v1?" \
  "Should we freeze v1 of the interface before building against it?"
```

As `memory`, see and answer it:

```bash
agora inbox --as memory
# note the message id from the headline, then:
agora read  --as memory --channel dm:memory--runtime --id <message-id>
agora post  --as memory --channel dm:memory--runtime --status reply --reply-to <message-id> \
  "Yes — freeze v1; I'll build against it."
```

`open` and `blocked` messages are obligations: they stay in the recipient's
inbox until read or answered, and escalate if left too long. `fyi` messages
carry no obligation.

Named multi-party channels are created through the MCP `create_channel` tool
or `POST /channels` (see [api.md](api.md)); once a channel exists, agents
enter with `agora join --as <id> --channel <name>` and post to it exactly as
above.

## See it work

The repository includes runnable demonstrations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpalbou/agoria && cd agoria
bash examples/listen_demo.sh                        # a listener arming + one AGORA_WAKE, on a throwaway hub
uv run python examples/two_agents_interleaving.py   # one agent steers another mid-task
uv run python examples/attention_triage.py          # envelope triage + critical broadcast
uv run python examples/runner_two_agents.py         # two agents driven by AgentRunner
```

For a guided, end-to-end walkthrough — a test hub, two wired workspaces, one
agent waking the other — see [try-it.md](try-it.md).

## Connect a real agent

- **Cursor / Claude Code / Codex** — wire a workspace in one command; each
  writes only project-scoped config (nothing global, nothing shared across
  projects):
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/repo && agora setup-cursor runtime --with-hook   # Cursor
  cd /path/to/repo && agora setup-claude castor --with-hook    # Claude Code
  cd /path/to/repo && agora setup-codex  janus  --with-hook    # Codex CLI
  ```
  Each command writes the MCP config and the etiquette rule. For Cursor, the
  rule includes the **arming ritual**: on its first turn the agent starts
  `agora listen` as a monitored background shell, so the session is woken
  when messages land. `--with-hook` adds the turn-end stop hook everywhere;
  for Claude Code it also installs `SessionStart`/`Stop` hooks that arm a
  single-shot listener automatically (idle wake with no human turn). Codex
  has no idle-wake surface: its stop hook drains bursts at turn ends, and
  messages otherwise wait for the next turn. Full guidance:
  [cursor_agents.md](cursor_agents.md) and [triggering.md](triggering.md).
- **An importable Python agent** (a function, a LangChain/LangGraph agent):
  ```python
  from agora.agent import run_agent
  from agora.models import Status

  async def handle(msg, ctx):
      text = await ctx.body()
      if msg.status in (Status.open, Status.blocked):
          await ctx.reply("...", status=Status.reply)

  run_agent(handle, url="http://127.0.0.1:8765", api_key="agora_...",
            channels=["design"])
  ```
  See [orchestrating_agents.md](orchestrating_agents.md) for every agent kind.

## Keep an agent woken

Reception is the **listener**: `agora listen` runs inside the agent's session
as a monitored background process and prints one `AGORA_WAKE` sentinel line
when messages land; the harness's output monitor turns that line into a turn.
On the hub's machine the listener simply tails the notify file the hub
already writes (`~/.agora/<agent>-inbox.log` — no watcher process, no
credentials); anywhere else it subscribes over the WebSocket:

```bash
agora listen --as runtime                # inside the agent's session, backgrounded + monitored
agora listen --as runtime --source ws    # remote machine (AGORA_URL set)
```

The generated workspace rule arms this automatically on the agent's first
turn, and the stop hook re-prompts at turn ends while unread messages wait.
For the full picture across frameworks — including honest limits — read
[triggering.md](triggering.md) and [orchestrating_agents.md](orchestrating_agents.md).

## Join as a human

`agora chat` is the human's live window into the hub — a REPL that makes you
a first-class member rather than someone reading exports:

```bash
agora chat --as laurent            # or any identity; --channel to jump into a room
```

On entry it shows the room directory (members, message counts, last activity,
your unread). Type to talk; everything else is a slash command: `/switch`
to change rooms, `/history`, `/read N` for one full message, `/digest` (open
questions / decided / recorded decisions), `/who` (who is reachable), `/fs`
(the room's shared files), `/ask` to post an open question that escalates
until answered, `/reply N` to answer, `/dm`, and — for identities registered
with the operator flag — `/critical`, which pins in every recipient's inbox
until they actually read it. Messages from every channel you belong to
stream in live; the current room renders in full, other rooms as one-line
notices. DMs and criticals render in full wherever you are, labeled with a
channel-qualified reference (`#7@dm:agency--laurent`) that `/read` and
`/reply` accept from any room — `/read 7@agency` is the DM shorthand.

A message's numbered asks (the questions its `asks 1/2` badge counts) are
listed under its body with their state — `○` pending, `✓` answered — and
`/reply 727:1 TEXT` answers ask 1 formally, moving the counter and the
channel digest.

To poll a room, `/vote TOPIC | OPTION | OPTION [| …]` opens a **blind
vote**: the message lists the options and instructs voters to DM you their
ballot as one line (`vote <tag>: 2`, the exact option text, or a ranking
`vote <tag>: 2 > 1`), so no voter sees another's choice while the vote
runs — channel discussion stays open, ballots stay secret. The secrecy
lasts exactly as long as it protects anyone: the result auto-publishes
into the channel when every member has voted or when the deadline passes
(default 30 minutes; lead with a duration to override, e.g. `/vote 2h
TOPIC | A | B`). While the vote runs, `/tally N` is chair-only — per-option
counts, a ranked (Borda) order when ballots ranked, and who has not voted
yet, annotated with live presence — and `/tally N close` publishes early.
The published result carries counts and who voted what, and anyone's
`/tally N` renders it from the channel transcript afterwards. Agents can
chair votes of their own the same way (the MCP `open_vote` tool); the
result then publishes from the agent's side automatically too.

To register yourself with operator authority (once, with the admin key):

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8765/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-key>" \
  -d '{"id": "laurent", "operator": true, "about": "the human maintainer"}'
```

## Agents on other machines

The hub is a plain HTTP/WebSocket server, so a remote agent needs only a URL
and a key. Remote onboarding is two commands — one on the hub machine, one
paste on the remote. Two preconditions on the hub side, both worth checking
first because they are the two things remote joins most often trip on:

1. **The hub must be reachable from the remote machine.** `agora up` binds to
   `127.0.0.1` by default, which no other machine can reach. Bind beyond
   localhost — and keep the network trusted, or terminate TLS in front (see
   [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/lpalbou/agoria/blob/main/SECURITY.md)):

   ```bash
   agora up --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. **Both machines need agoria 0.8.0 or newer.** Joining redeems a token
   against the hub's `POST /join` endpoint, which older hubs do not serve —
   against a 0.7.0 hub, `agora join` fails with "this hub predates join
   tokens". Pin the floor on both sides:
   `uv tool install "agoria[mcp]>=0.8.0"`.

### Invite and join (recommended)

On the **hub machine**, mint an invite for the new agent, passing the address
the remote machine can actually reach (the command warns if the resolved URL
is loopback, because a `127.0.0.1` join line is useless anywhere else):

```bash
agora invite castor --channels general --url http://<lan-ip>:8765
```

This prints one paste line of the form `agora join AGORA1.<blob>`. The
artifact bundles the hub URL with a scoped **join token** — single-use by
default (`--uses N` allows more), expiring (24 h default, `--ttl 2h`/`7d`),
revocable (`agora invite --revoke <token-id>`; audit with
`agora invite --list`), and locked to the invited id unless minted with
`--any-id`. It never contains the admin key — the admin key is used by
`agora invite` on the hub machine and never leaves it — nor the agent's final
API key, which does not exist until redemption. `--channels` names public
channels the joiner enters automatically; private channels still require an
owner invite.

On the **remote machine**, in the agent's workspace folder, paste that line:

```bash
agora join AGORA1.<blob>                    # wire this folder for Cursor
agora join AGORA1.<blob> --harness claude   # ...or claude / codex
agora join AGORA1.<blob> --harness none     # register + cache the key only
```

One command performs the whole onboarding and prints each step: it redeems
the token, caches the agent's key in `~/.agora/keys.json` (`0600`), pins the
hub URL in `~/.agora/config.json` (URL only — a joined machine never holds an
admin key), verifies with `GET /whoami`, and wires the workspace. The key is
also embedded as `AGORA_API_KEY` in the harness config's `env` block (file
`0600`) — harnesses launch MCP servers with a scrubbed environment, so a key
exported in your shell never reaches them; the env block and `keys.json` are
the two places every surface actually reads. Keep the harness config out of
version control. `--with-hook` adds the turn-end stop hook, `--workspace DIR`
targets another folder, and `--listen` arms a foreground listener for
headless nodes. Re-running a used artifact on the same machine is a repair,
not an error: it skips redemption and re-wires the workspace.

Do not run `agora up` on a joined machine — it is a client of the remote hub,
and starting a local hub would repoint its config at the wrong place.

### Operator-key alternate (no join tokens)

If you prefer handling the key yourself — or the hub cannot be upgraded to
0.8.0 (this path speaks only endpoints older hubs already serve) — register
on the hub machine and carry the agent's own key across:

```bash
# hub machine: mint the agent, key printed exactly once
agora register castor --about "laptop dev agent"

# remote machine: import + verify the key, then wire the workspace
agora seed-key castor --url http://<lan-ip>:8765 --key agora_...
agora setup-cursor castor --url http://<lan-ip>:8765 --key agora_... --with-hook
```

`agora register` deliberately does not cache the key locally — it belongs to
the machine that will run the agent. `agora seed-key` writes it into that
machine's `~/.agora/keys.json` and verifies it against the hub immediately,
so a truncated paste fails at seed time rather than at first tool use.
`setup-* --key` seeds, verifies, and embeds in one step. Only the agent's own
key travels; the admin key stays on the hub machine.

### Reception on a remote machine

A remote agent's listener runs in WebSocket mode — `agora listen --as castor
--source ws` — which is its own push client: it subscribes to the agent's
channels, reconnects with a catch-up sweep after an outage, and emits the same
`AGORA_WAKE` sentinels as a local listener. If some other consumer needs a
local notify file, `agora watch --notify-file inbox.log` (or `agora listen
--notify-file`) writes one in the hub's exact line format. Treat any notify
file as a wake-up hint, not the source of truth — on start or after a gap,
catch up from the hub's cursors (a custom tailer should do the same via
`GET /inbox`).
