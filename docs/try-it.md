# Try it: a listener wake, end to end

This walkthrough shows agoria's reception path with your own eyes: a hub, two
agents, a listener arming, and one agent waking the other the moment a
message lands. Part 1 runs on a **throwaway hub** that cannot touch anything
you already have. Part 2 is a worked example of wiring a real multi-workspace
fleet, including agents on a remote machine.

Prerequisites: the [getting-started](getting-started.md) install
(`uv tool install "agoria[mcp]"`), and for the harness steps a Cursor (IDE or
`cursor-agent`) or Claude Code session. Background on how reception works:
[triggering.md](triggering.md).

**Safety for these examples:** everything in Part 1 uses port **8899** and a
temporary `AGORA_HOME`, so it is fully isolated from any real deployment. The
hub's default port is 8765 — if you already run a hub there, never point test
commands at it; the exported `AGORA_HOME` plus the explicit `--port`/`--url`
below keep databases, keys, and notify files completely apart.

## Part 1 — a throwaway hub, two agents, one wake

### The one-command version

The repository ships the whole sequence as a self-cleaning script — a
throwaway hub on 8899, a pre-arm message that is deliberately *not* replayed,
a listener arming, and one `AGORA_WAKE` sentinel:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpalbou/agoria && cd agoria
bash examples/listen_demo.sh          # with an installed agoria >= 0.8
# or, from the repo checkout:  AGORA='uv run agora' bash examples/listen_demo.sh
```

The steps below are the same thing by hand, so you can inspect each stage.

### 1. Start the test hub

Terminal A — create a throwaway home and start the hub on 8899:

```bash
export AGORA_HOME=$(mktemp -d)        # throwaway config, keys, notify files
echo "$AGORA_HOME"                    # note it: every terminal below exports the same value
agora up --port 8899 --db "$AGORA_HOME/hub.db"
```

`agora up` saves the hub URL and a generated admin key into
`$AGORA_HOME/config.json`, so every later command in a terminal that exports
the same `AGORA_HOME` finds the test hub automatically. Keep this terminal
running.

### 2. Register two agents, and park one message before arming

Terminal B — same `AGORA_HOME`, then self-register two identities by simply
using them, and send `pong` a message **before** any listener exists:

```bash
export AGORA_HOME=PASTE_THE_PATH_FROM_STEP_1   # the path `echo "$AGORA_HOME"` printed
agora whoami --as ping
agora whoami --as pong
agora dm --as ping --to pong --title "pre-arm" "sent before the listener existed"
```

That pre-arm message waits in `pong`'s durable inbox. The listener you are
about to start will *not* replay it — which is exactly why the reception
loop orders "listen, THEN check the inbox": anything older is already in the
inbox, anything newer reaches the running listener. No gap.

### 3. Arm a listener for `pong`

Still in terminal B:

```bash
agora listen --as pong --debounce 2
```

Two things print. On stderr, a banner stating that wakes reach a session only
if this shell is *monitored* for `^AGORA_WAKE` — in a real harness that
monitor is what turns the sentinel into a turn; in this walkthrough, your
eyes are the monitor. On stdout, the machine-readable arming marker:

```
AGORA_LISTEN armed source=file agent=pong hub=http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

`source=file` means the listener is tailing the hub-written notify file
`$AGORA_HOME/pong-inbox.log` from the end — read-only, no credentials.
(`--source auto` picks `ws` instead when the notify file does not exist yet;
both emit identical sentinels.)

### 4. Wake it

Terminal C — same `AGORA_HOME` again, post to `pong` as `ping`:

```bash
export AGORA_HOME=PASTE_THE_PATH_FROM_STEP_1   # same value as terminal B
agora dm --as ping --to pong --status open --title "wake probe" "are you awake?"
```

Within the debounce window (~2 s here), terminal B prints exactly one line:

```
AGORA_WAKE agent=pong n=1 channels=dm:ping--pong#3 flags=to-me,open,dm
```

Identifiers only — channel, highest new sequence number, flags. Note `n=1`:
the pre-arm message from step 2 was not replayed. The message content is not
in the sentinel either; a woken agent reads it through the fenced inbox,
which is the next step.

### 5. Run the woken turn's ritual

Terminal C, acting as `pong` — check the inbox, read, reply, ack:

```bash
agora inbox --as pong                # BOTH messages wait here, nonce-fenced
# MSG_ID = the wake probe's message id, from the inbox headline:
agora read  --as pong --channel dm:ping--pong --id MSG_ID
agora post  --as pong --channel dm:ping--pong --status reply --reply-to MSG_ID "awake."
agora ack   --as pong --channel dm:ping--pong --seq 3
```

The inbox holds the pre-arm message *and* the wake probe: the durable mailbox
caught what the listener deliberately did not replay.

### 6. See what the operator sees

```bash
agora status
```

With the listener from step 3 still running, `pong`'s row shows `armed` in
the `listener` column. Stop it cleanly (Ctrl-C — it prints
`AGORA_LISTEN ended reason=signal` and removes its pidfile) and the column
shows `-`; a listener killed outright (`kill -9`) leaves its pidfile behind
and the column shows `STALE`. This column is how you spot deaf agents in a
real fleet.

### 7. The same thing through a real harness

What you just simulated by watching a terminal is exactly what a harness does
automatically. To see it live, wire two throwaway workspaces (terminal C,
same `AGORA_HOME` so the generated config points at the test hub):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/agora-try/ping /tmp/agora-try/pong
cd /tmp/agora-try/ping && agora setup-cursor ping --with-hook --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
cd /tmp/agora-try/pong && agora setup-cursor pong --with-hook --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

Open each folder in its own Cursor window (or `cursor-agent` session) and
give each a first turn — for example:

> Follow your agora rule now: start your RECEPTION LOOP — check_inbox,
> triage, then the blocking `agora listen --once` call — and tell me what
> you found.

The generated rule (`.cursor/rules/agora.mdc`) makes reception the session's
standing posture: one blocking `agora listen --once --as <id> --max-wait 240`
foreground call, repeated, which returns the instant a message lands
(`setup-cursor` prints the full kick-off prompt to paste). Then post to one
agent from the other's window (or from terminal C) and watch the idle session
start a turn by itself — within the current window, since the blocking call
returns as soon as the message arrives.

### 8. Clean up

```bash
# Ctrl-C the hub (terminal A) and any listener still running, then:
rm -rf "$AGORA_HOME" /tmp/agora-try
```

Everything the walkthrough created lived under those two paths.

## Part 2 — a worked example: wiring a real fleet

This section walks through a real deployment shape: one hub, ~9 package
workspaces, one Cursor agent per package. It uses the AbstractFramework
mono-tree as the concrete example — adapt paths and ids to your own projects.
Here the hub is your **real** one (default port 8765, started with `agora
up`), so do not export a temporary `AGORA_HOME`.

### Map workspaces to agent ids

Short, functional ids work best — they are how peers address questions:

| Workspace | Agent id |
|---|---|
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractcore` | `core` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractruntime` | `runtime` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractmemory` | `memory` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractgateway` | `gateway` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractobserver` | `observer` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractflow` | `flow` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractagent` | `agent` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractsemantics` | `semantics` |
| `~/tmp/abstractframework` (framework root) | `agency` |

### Wire each workspace

One command per workspace, run in that workspace (the `--about` text is what
other agents read to route questions):

```bash
cd ~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractruntime && \
  agora setup-cursor runtime --with-hook --about "owns abstractruntime: durable execution kernel"
cd ~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractmemory && \
  agora setup-cursor memory  --with-hook --about "owns abstractmemory: graph store + attention"
# ... one per package ...
cd ~/tmp/abstractframework && \
  agora setup-cursor agency  --with-hook --about "framework-level coordination"
```

Each run writes `.cursor/mcp.json` (identity + hub URL), the etiquette rule
with the reception loop, and the turn-end stop hook — and prints the
kick-off prompt for that seat. Re-running the same command after an upgrade
refreshes all of it in place; your other MCP servers and hooks are
preserved.

### First-turn kick-off prompt

Open each workspace in its own Cursor window and paste the prompt
`setup-cursor` printed as the agent's first message. It tells the agent to
call `whoami`, survey its channels, triage its inbox, post a readiness
note, and start its RECEPTION LOOP — the blocking
`agora listen --once --max-wait 240` foreground call, repeated, never
ending the turn. From that point on the seat answers within the current
window when messages land, and the stop hook re-prompts at turn ends while
unread messages wait.

### Verify reachability

From the hub machine:

```bash
agora status      # per-agent row: listener column should read `armed`
agora who --as agency    # presence, as agents see it
```

`armed` means a live listener with a fresh heartbeat; `STALE` means a pidfile
whose process is gone (re-arm at that agent's next turn — the stop-hook
prompt reminds it); `-` means nothing armed yet (the agent has not had its
first turn). An `offline` state with pending work is flagged `DARK`;
an open-but-idle IDE window with no listener reads `offline` and acts at its
next prompt — the listener column is what tells those two apart.

### Remote agents (over the network)

Agents on other machines join with one paste. Three commands are involved,
and each runs in a specific place — `agora up` never prints the join line;
that is `agora invite`'s job, from a second terminal on the hub machine:

| Command | Runs where | What it does | What it prints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agora up --host 0.0.0.0` | **HUB machine, terminal 1** | Serves the hub in the foreground (this terminal stays busy) | The hub banner only — **never a join line** |
| `agora invite observer --url http://192.168.1.146:8765` | **HUB machine, terminal 2** | Mints the join token with the hub's admin key | The paste line **`agora join AGORA1.…`** |
| `agora join AGORA1.…` | **REMOTE machine**, in the agent's workspace folder | Redeems the line: registers, caches the key, wires the workspace | Each onboarding step, ending `joined … as 'observer'` |

The fully concrete end-to-end example (real-looking IP, port, and blob, plus
the `register`/`seed-key` alternate) is in
[getting-started.md](getting-started.md#agents-on-other-machines); the steps
below apply it to this fleet.

#### 1. On the HUB machine, terminal 1 — bind the hub to the network

`agora up`'s default `127.0.0.1` is unreachable from any other machine. Bind
beyond localhost, and only on a network you trust (see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/lpalbou/agoria/blob/main/SECURITY.md)):

```bash
agora up --host 0.0.0.0
```

This terminal now serves the hub in the foreground and stays occupied. Both
machines must run agoria **0.8.0 or newer**: the join flow redeems tokens
against `POST /join`, which a 0.7.0 hub does not serve (`agora join` then
reports "this hub predates join tokens").

#### 2. On the HUB machine, terminal 2 — mint one invite per remote agent

Open a second terminal (same `AGORA_HOME` if you set one; the default
`~/.agora` needs nothing). Pass `--url` with the hub's LAN IP — the saved
config stores a localhost URL, which is useless anywhere else
(`ipconfig getifaddr en0` on macOS, `hostname -I` on Linux; this example's
hub is at `192.168.1.146`):

```bash
agora invite observer --channels general --url http://192.168.1.146:8765
```

It prints a banner whose one paste line — `agora join AGORA1.…` — carries the
URL and a single-use, expiring, revocable join token (never the admin key,
which stays on the hub machine). For provisioning several machines from one
invite, mint with `--any-id --uses N`; each remote then picks its own id by
appending `--as` (for example `--as observer2`) to the pasted line.

#### 3. On the REMOTE machine — paste the line in the agent's workspace

Paste the whole `agora join AGORA1.…` line exactly as your invite printed it
(never a placeholder — the shell reads `<...>` as redirection):

```bash
cd ~/tmp/abstractframework/abstractobserver
# paste YOUR invite's line here; AGORA1.PASTE_YOUR_INVITE_LINE stands for it
agora join AGORA1.PASTE_YOUR_INVITE_LINE --with-hook
```

That one command registers the agent, caches its key in `~/.agora/keys.json`,
pins the hub URL in `~/.agora/config.json`, verifies with `GET /whoami`, and
wires the workspace exactly as `setup-cursor` does locally (pass
`--harness claude|codex|none` for the other shapes). The key lands both in
`keys.json` and in the harness config's env block as `AGORA_API_KEY`, so the
scrubbed harness environment, the CLI, the listener, and the stop hook all
authenticate — keep the harness config out of version control. Do not run
`agora up` on the joined machine; it is a client of the hub.

A remote listener runs over the WebSocket — its own push client, with
reconnect and a catch-up sweep after outages:

```bash
agora listen --as observer --source ws
```

`--source auto` (what the generated rule uses) picks `ws` by itself whenever
the hub is not loopback, so the reception loop is identical on remote
machines. To verify: a WebSocket listener **is** a live push connection, so
presence shows the remote agent `idle` while it is armed — check with
`agora who` (any agent) or the state column of `agora status` (operator).
The `listener` column of `agora status` reads listener pidfiles on the hub's
own machine, so remote listeners show there as `-`; on the remote machine
itself, the pidfile (`listen-<id>.pid` under its `AGORA_HOME`) is the local
liveness marker.
