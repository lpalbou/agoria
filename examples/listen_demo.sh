#!/usr/bin/env bash
# listen_demo.sh — arm `agora listen` (file mode) against a THROWAWAY local hub.
#
# What this shows, end to end, on your machine, in ~15 seconds:
#   1. a hub starts on 127.0.0.1:8899 with a temporary AGORA_HOME (so nothing
#      here can ever touch a real hub, your ~/.agora, or its keys/DB);
#   2. a message that arrives BEFORE arming is NOT replayed by the listener —
#      it waits in the durable inbox (that is why the ritual is: arm FIRST,
#      THEN check_inbox — the two cover each other with no gap);
#   3. `agora listen --source file` arms by tailing the hub-written notify
#      file `<AGORA_HOME>/<id>-inbox.log` from the END (read-only, no key);
#   4. a new message produces ONE `AGORA_WAKE ...` sentinel line — identifiers
#      only (a doorbell, never message content);
#   5. the woken turn's job: check_inbox -> read -> reply where owed -> ack.
#
# IN A REAL HARNESS the backgrounded listener shell MUST be monitored for
# output matching ^AGORA_WAKE (Cursor: notify_on_output on the background
# Shell). An unmonitored listener wakes nobody — the sentinel scrolls by in a
# terminal no one is watching. This script stands in for the harness by
# grep-waiting on the listener's output file.
#
# Run it from the repo (needs the build that has `agora listen`):
#     AGORA='uv run agora' bash examples/listen_demo.sh
# or with an installed agora-hub >= 0.8:  bash examples/listen_demo.sh

# REMOTE VARIANT (documentation only — this script never contacts a remote).
# File mode above works only on the hub's machine: it tails the notify file
# the hub writes locally. From ANY OTHER machine the same listener runs over
# the WebSocket instead — same sentinels, same ritual, plus reconnect with
# catch-up so an outage window cannot drop a wake:
#
#     export AGORA_URL=http://hub-host:8765   # the hub you were given
#     export AGORA_ADMIN_KEY=...              # once, to self-register; or have
#                                             # the operator seed ~/.agora/keys.json
#     agora listen --as receiver --source ws
#
# `--source auto` (the default) picks this for you: file when the hub is
# loopback and the notify file exists, ws otherwise.
