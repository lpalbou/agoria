"""Regenerate llms-full.txt: a faithful aggregation of the core documentation
corpus in one AI-readable file. Run from the repo root after editing docs.

The corpus is the core doc set plus the reception deep dive and the try-it
walkthrough — the pages an LLM needs to answer "what is this, how do I run
it, how do agents get woken". Deep dives that are highly harness-specific
(cursor_agents, orchestrating_agents, agent_guide) stay index-only pointers
in llms.txt to keep this file focused.
