"""Screen a candidate PyPI project name for collisions BEFORE renaming.

PyPI rejects a new name if it collides with an existing project under either:
  1. PEP 503 normalization  — lowercase; runs of - _ . collapse to a single '-'
     (so `Agora_Hub`, `agora.hub`, `agora--hub` all == `agora-hub`).
  2. PyPI's stricter "too similar" check — effectively lowercase and strip ALL
     non-alphanumerics, then compare (so `agora-hub` ~ `agorahub` ~ `agora.hub`).

This tool checks a candidate's PEP 503 form and its fully-stripped form against
the live PyPI index. It catches the common rejection causes. It is NOT a
perfect replica of PyPI's unicode-confusable logic, so treat a PASS as "very
likely accepted" — the only 100% authoritative check is the upload itself
(PyPI validates the name server-side first; see the note this script prints).

Usage:
    python scripts/check_pypi_name.py agorahub agora-hub agora.hub
