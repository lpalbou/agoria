"""Export the hub's served OpenAPI schema as a release artifact (agora-0118).

    python3 scripts/export_openapi.py            # writes ./openapi.json
    python3 scripts/export_openapi.py --check    # CI: fail if stale

The export is DESCRIPTIVE, NOT NORMATIVE: it is generated from the running
implementation (FastAPI + the typed response models), so it is exact for the
code it ships with — but the wire contract's semantics, canonicalization and
version-bump policy live in docs/protocol.md, and the document says so
inside itself (it will be read far from this repo). Since the parity spine
(0.12.30) the artifact is COMMITTED at the repo root and TS/JS clients
generate their types from it (`npx openapi-typescript openapi.json`).

`--check` is the SHAPE-drift tripwire: a change to any typed route that is
not reflected in the committed artifact fails CI, which is exactly the
moment a version bump / PROTOCOL_SEMANTICS entry must be considered. Scope
honesty (adversary P0-1): this catches SCHEMA changes only — a behavior
change with an unchanged schema (the 0102 class) is invisible here and is
the golden vectors' job (tests/vectors/). The two guards are complements,
not substitutes.

The compared document deliberately carries the WIRE-PROTOCOL version, not
the app version (adversary P1-1): an artifact that churns on every release
trains reviewers to rubber-stamp the diff, and the one diff that matters is
then skimmed. The app version rides the per-release export in release.yml.
