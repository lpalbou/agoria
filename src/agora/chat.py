"""`agora chat` — the human's live window into the hub.

A REPL that makes the human a first-class channel member: a room directory
with stats on entry, live streaming of every message on every channel you
belong to (the current room rendered in full, other rooms as one-line
notices), and posting with the same obligation semantics agents use — plain
text posts `fyi`, `/ask` opens an obligation, `/critical` is the operator's
forced-attention tier.

Design notes:
- This is a HUMAN surface. The nonce-fencing applied to LLM-facing renders
  (see render.py) exists so a model cannot mistake quoted content for
  operator instructions; a human reading a terminal needs attribution, not
  fences, so messages render chat-style with explicit sender/status.
- Everything displayed is acked (triage-seen). Obligations and criticals
  stay pinned server-side until actually read/answered — acking here never
  discharges anything, so the human cannot accidentally "lose" work signals.
- Input uses prompt_toolkit when available (input line survives concurrent
  output); falls back to plain stdin otherwise.
