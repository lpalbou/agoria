"""SQLite persistence layer.

Single-writer, lock-guarded synchronous access. For the local-first
deployments this hub targets (a handful of agents on one machine or LAN),
SQLite operations are microseconds; serializing them behind one lock is
simpler and safer than async drivers. The wire protocol is backend-agnostic,
so this module can be swapped for NATS JetStream or a Rust hub later without
touching clients (see docs/KnowledgeBase.md).

Security note: api keys and invite tokens are stored hashed (sha256) — the
database file never contains usable bearer secrets.
