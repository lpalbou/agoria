"""Attention policy: what gets delivered, inlined, escalated, and downgraded.

Distilled from the v0.2 adversarial design review (docs/KnowledgeBase.md):

- Importance is DERIVED, never sender-declared: obligations (status),
  addressing (to_me/reply_to_me, hub-computed), authority (critical).
  A free-form priority field was rejected — sender-declared severity decays
  to noise between LLMs (severity inflation) and doubles the spoof surface.
- Body inlining follows the token economics: an envelope-then-fetch round
  trip costs more than a small body, so small bodies are always inlined;
  only large, low-urgency, non-addressed bodies are envelope-only.
- Obligations must not rot: unanswered open/blocked messages older than the
  channel SLA are escalated by the hub (a disinterested party raising
  urgency by obligation AGE — the anti-inflation mechanism).
- Interrupts cost budget: over-budget interrupts are downgraded to
  next_turn and visibly marked, so crying wolf has a price.
