"""Hub-written notify files: liveness without resident processes.

The file mailbox never had a liveness problem because the file was maintained
by the same thing that stored the data. This is agora's equivalent: the hub —
the one process that must exist anyway — appends one JSON line per delivered
message to `<notify_dir>/<agent>-inbox.log` for every member of the message's
channel. No watcher processes, no supervisors, no OS services: an agent (or
its harness) just tails its file, which is fresh for exactly as long as the
hub is up — and if the hub is down there is nothing to be notified about.

`agora watch` still exists for remote clients (a file on the hub's machine is
useless to them), but on the hub's own machine it is now redundant — and
running one against the same file would duplicate lines. `agora listen` only
READS these files (tail from END), preserving that invariant.

Hardening (proposal_1 §7): notify lines carry titles + previews, so the dir is
clamped to 0700 and files to 0600 (repaired on first write per process, which
heals files created by earlier versions). Growth is bounded: above `rotate_mb`
MB the file is atomically renamed to `<file>.1` (one generation) and a fresh
file starts — `agora listen` follows by name and reopens (tail -F semantics).

Best-effort by design: a failed file write must never fail a post.
