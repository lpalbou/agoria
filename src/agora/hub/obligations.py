"""Obligation discharge and closure: is an open/blocked message settled yet?

Two DISCHARGE modes, chosen by the message itself:

- **binary** (legacy / no structured asks): any reply from someone other than
  the asker discharges the obligation. This is the original behavior and is
  preserved exactly for messages that carry no `asks`.
- **asks** (structured): the message carries numbered `asks` (stored in
  `data.asks`); a reply discharges specific ones by listing their ids in its
  `data.answers`. The obligation is discharged only when EVERY ask has a
  matching answer from a non-sender reply — so a reply that answers 1 of 3
  no longer silently clears the whole message (the partial-answer rot the
  file protocol suffered). This is the agents' unanimous top request, made
  mechanical: importance follows unanswered asks, not a sender's say-so.

CLOSURE (backlog 0062, ADR-0003) is the second, orthogonal way a thread
settles: a `resolved`-status reply closes the obligation on EVERY surface
(inbox stickiness, escalation, digest) when its author has the authority to
close — the ASKER (closing your own question is loud, attributed and
in-thread, unlike the silent self-answering the non-sender rule exists to
prevent), an OPERATOR, or ANY member whose resolved reply carries a
`settled_by` pointer naming the message that settled the question (the
audited supersession path for rulings that landed outside the thread — the
c713/c726 incident class). A third party's bare resolved reply deliberately
does NOT close: closure by strangers needs the pointer's audit trail.

Pure functions over already-loaded messages, so they are trivially testable and
carry no transport or storage concerns.
