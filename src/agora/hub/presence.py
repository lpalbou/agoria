"""In-memory presence: is an agent offline, idle, or working?

Presence tells peers and the operator whether an agent is reachable NOW
(`who_is_reachable`, `agora status`): don't block on a quick reply from an
offline agent; an idle-but-alive one hears its listener. It is advisory,
not authoritative — an agent that crashes without saying goodbye simply
ages out.

Liveness is CONNECTION-derived, not heartbeat-derived: while an agent holds
at least one live WebSocket, it is present (its last declared state stands),
because a socket the hub can push to *is* reachability — no client-side
heartbeat protocol to forget. The staleness window only applies to agents
with no live connection. A peer that vanished without FIN (power loss, NAT
drop) keeps its refcount until the server's WS keepalive gives up — cmd_up
pins ws_ping_interval/ws_ping_timeout so that window is bounded (~40s).

THREAD-SAFETY INVARIANT: connect()/disconnect() (read-modify-write on the
refcount) run ONLY on the serving event loop (the WS endpoint). update()/
get() may run on threadpool workers (REST handlers) but are single
GIL-atomic dict operations. Do not call connect/disconnect from REST paths.
