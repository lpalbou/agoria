        exactly the excuse behind silently dropped directives (operator,
        2026-07-19: 'it MUST be'). The rule, mechanical:

        - OPERATOR sender, status reply OR fyi: always obliges the named
          seats. Human words are few and never chatter; a DM auto-addresses
          (c3073), so every operator DM line lands here regardless of the
          status the composer picked. The operator ends a thread with
          status=resolved (closes), never by being ignored.
        - PEER sender, status reply: obliges the named seats UNLESS it is
          the sender's answer coming back to you — i.e. it replies to YOUR
          OWN message. Your debt for an answer is CONSUMPTION (0078's
          to_consume), not another reply; this exemption is also what
          terminates ack chains ('thanks' replying to their answer obliges
          them nothing) instead of ping-ponging forever.
        - PEER sender, status fyi: never obliges — fyi is the documented
          terminal gesture ('no reply owed'), and DMs auto-address, so
          without a non-obliging status no DM thread could ever end.
        - A reply carrying `answers` never obliges (both classes): it
          discharges an ask; the asker's debt is consumption.
