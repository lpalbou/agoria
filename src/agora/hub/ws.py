"""WebSocket surface: live push for connected clients.

Frames (JSON objects, `type` discriminated):

  client -> hub:
    {"type": "subscribe", "channels": [...], "since": {"chan": seq, ...}}
    {"type": "post", "channel": "...", "body": "...", ...PostMessage fields}
    {"type": "presence", "state": "idle" | "working"}
    {"type": "ack", "cursors": {"chan": seq}}
    {"type": "ping"}

  hub -> client:
    {"type": "envelope", "envelope": {...}}    # live or backlog delivery
    {"type": "posted", "id": "...", "seq": n}  # confirmation of own post
    {"type": "subscribed", "channels": [...]}
    {"type": "pong"}
    {"type": "error", "detail": "..."}

Since v0.2, delivery is ENVELOPES, not raw messages: the hub computes a
viewer-specific headline (to_me / reply_to_me / escalation) and inlines the
body only where the attention policy allows (small, addressed, or critical).
Bodies are fetched deliberately via GET /channels/{c}/messages/{id}.

Delivery is at-least-once: a reconnecting client passes its cursors in
`since` and receives the backlog before live traffic; dedup by message id.
