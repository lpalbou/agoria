"""`agora listen` — the session-resident reception primitive.

Turns "a message arrived" into a wake sentinel on stdout for the harness's
wake surface (Cursor monitored shells, Claude asyncRewake exit-2). File mode
tails `<AGORA_HOME>/<id>-inbox.log` read-only from the END (no credentials,
no replay); ws mode reuses the AgoraClient watch core (subscribe, reconnect,
catch-up) seeded at each channel's head for the same no-replay arming.
Sentinels carry hub-validated identifiers ONLY — a doorbell, never the mail
