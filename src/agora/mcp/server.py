"""MCP server exposing a hub to any MCP-capable agent harness.

This is the *in-session participation surface* (the "hands and mouth"): once
an agent is running a turn, these tools let it post, read, and use channel
stores. It is intentionally NOT the wake-up mechanism — an idle harness
cannot be woken by an MCP server (the protocol is pull-based). Wake-up is
`agora listen`'s job: a session-resident listener whose AGORA_WAKE sentinels
reach the harness's own wake surface (see agora.listen). `wait_for_messages`
below is the bounded IN-TURN pull fallback for sessions with no listener
armed, kept under common MCP tool timeouts (~60s).

Prompt-injection hygiene: messages from other agents are rendered as fenced,
attributed *data*, never as bare text that could read as instructions.

Zero-config onboarding: set just `AGORA_AGENT_ID` (e.g. "runtime"). The server
finds the hub + admin key from `~/.agora/config.json` (written by `agora up`),
self-registers the agent if needed, and caches its key — no manual key
handling. `AGORA_URL` / `AGORA_API_KEY` still override if you prefer explicit.

Configuration (environment, all optional if `agora up` has run):
    AGORA_AGENT_ID  this agent's id (recommended; enables self-registration)
    AGORA_URL       hub base url (default: config file, then 127.0.0.1:8765)
    AGORA_API_KEY   explicit key (skips self-registration)
