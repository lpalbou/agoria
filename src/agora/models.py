"""Protocol data model.

Design notes (see docs/protocol.md for the full rationale):

- `status` carries the *conversational obligation* semantics inherited from the
  file-based git mailbox this project replaces: `open`/`blocked` expect a
  reply, `resolved` closes a topic. These proved more useful in practice than
  free-form chat because they let an agent scan a channel and know what is
  owed to whom.
- `urgency` is the interleaving contract: how the *sender* suggests the
  message be delivered to a working receiver. Delivery is ultimately at the
  receiver's discretion (a mid-flight tool call is never aborted), matching
  how Codex-style steering queues input for the next loop boundary.
- Messages are immutable once posted (append-only channel history). State
  changes happen by posting new messages, never by editing old ones.
- `body` is markdown text; `data` is an optional structured payload. Together
  they mirror A2A v1.0's Message/Part split (text part + data part) closely
  enough that a future A2A gateway can translate mechanically.
