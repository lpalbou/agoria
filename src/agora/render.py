"""Safe rendering of untrusted agent content into an LLM's context.

Threat (v0.3 finding C-2): message bodies/titles are authored by other
agents. If they are wrapped in a *static* textual fence (`<<<MESSAGE ...
>>>END`), a body can simply contain `>>>END` followed by forged
`SYSTEM:`/operator instructions, escaping the fence and injecting commands
into the reader's model. A static delimiter around attacker-controlled text
is not a security boundary.

Fix: an UNPREDICTABLE per-render nonce delimiter. The reader is told, once,
that everything between `⟦AGORA:<nonce>⟧` and `⟦/AGORA:<nonce>⟧` is quoted
data — and the sender cannot close a fence whose nonce it never saw (the
nonce is minted at render time, after the message was authored). As defense
in depth we also neutralize any literal fence-token substrings in the
untrusted fields, so even a guessed structure cannot break out.

This module is transport-agnostic and shared by the MCP adapter and the
attache digest renderer, so the hardening is defined once.
