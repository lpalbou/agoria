"""The anti-lurk mechanics (0077-0080), from the 2026-07-13 field failure:
seats ran compliant reception loops — listen, ack, re-arm — while acting on
nothing. Forensics on the live hub found the mechanical gaps these tests pin:
70 asks in 48h named seats only in prose (flagging nobody), answers to one's
own asks were silently ackable, and read-but-unanswered debt was invisible.

- 0077 per-ask addressing: asks[].to flags and pins the named seats.
- 0078 asker-side consumption: an unread, unfollowed answer to your own ask
  is a visible debt.
- 0079 the owed surface: GET /owed ignores read receipts on purpose.
- 0080 lurk visibility: acked_unanswered in the operator overview.
