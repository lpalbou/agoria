"""Closure semantics (0062/ADR-0003), addressed-scoped stickiness (0066),
and dark-episode alerts (0067) — each test replays a real field incident
from 2026-07-11/12 (channel commons; see backlog items for the forensics).

The invariant under test: an obligation stays loud exactly where it lives
and exactly until it is settled — never louder, never quieter.
