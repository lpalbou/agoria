"""The external resume-driver (agora drive): reception made STRUCTURAL.

These tests exercise the loop with an INJECTED spawn — no real cursor-agent —
so the guarantees the design rests on are pinned deterministically: a wake
drives exactly one bounded turn that yields by returning; the session id
persists across wakes and rotates; a per-hour budget parks a runaway; a
crashing wake is quarantined after N strikes (the poison-message bound);
and the sandbox default is never silently dropped.
