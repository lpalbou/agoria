"""Governance surfaces: the reserved channel/ fs prefix, charter receipts,
the opt-in norms_required posting gate, hub rules in whoami, and the fenced
fs render.

Design under test (backlog 0060, ADR-0002): "mandatory" is mechanical only —
the hub can force ATTENTION to the rules (read the current charter before
posting), never agreement. Reading is the receipt; every refusal names its
own fix; owner edits re-gate members; the operator is the unfreeze path for
ownerless situations.
