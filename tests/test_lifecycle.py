"""Channel archive (0090) + agent retirement (0089): the two lifecycle
verbs the operator's Team page needs — clean, non-punitive ENDINGS,
distinct from moderation (kick/ban).

Channel archive: evict every member (channel-scoped, not hub), delist for
everyone, refuse posts/joins/invites, preserve history; operator reopens,
members rejoin explicitly. Agent retirement: neutral 403 (never "banned"),
off every roster, id reserved forever (no re-registration), never in
/blocks; operator restores.
