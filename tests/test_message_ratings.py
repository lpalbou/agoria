"""One reputation system (agora-0122, operator ruling dm#111): a ± on a
message IS reputation input about its sender.

What must hold (from the two adversarial design reviews):
- ONE standing rating per (message, rater): PUT flips, DELETE withdraws,
  nothing ever stacks (the NULL-hole class is closed by the NOT NULL PK).
- Counting rule (operator dm#134): voting is per message (mechanics);
  the SCORE counts each colleague once per category (net-sign collapse).
  Honesty = visible raters count + per-message idempotency + budget.
- Gates: no self-rating, no system/retracted/foreign-channel targets,
  budget-limited writes.
- Lifecycle parity: leave, kick and retire all clear the rater's ratings
  (the kick door previously stranded votes — fixed in the same change).
- Board shape (0123): one score + per-category breakdown {score,up,down,raters}.
- Migration: OPERATOR reaction rows convert once (meta-guarded); agent rows
  and withdrawn/self/system rows never do.
