"""Moderation: kick (timed block) and ban (permanent block), channel and hub.

Invariants under test:
- a kick removes membership NOW and blocks BOTH rejoin paths (public join,
  owner-minted invite) until expiry; expiry re-admits without ceremony;
- a ban is the same block with no expiry; lifting works for both;
- authority: channel scope = owner or operator; hub scope = operator only;
- hub scope is a full lockout: every authenticated call refuses with a
  teaching 403, and the id cannot re-register its way back in;
- operators can never be blocked; you cannot block yourself; DM channels
  have no kicks; blocks are visible hub state (GET /blocks).
