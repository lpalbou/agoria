"""The committed openapi.json is the release artifact TS clients generate
their types from (agora-0118 move 1). This test is the SHAPE-drift tripwire:
any route/model change that alters the served schema fails here until the
artifact is regenerated (scripts/export_openapi.py) — which is exactly the
moment to ask whether the change needs a version bump and a
PROTOCOL_SEMANTICS entry.

Scope honesty (adversary P0-1): shape only. A behavior change with an
unchanged schema — the 0102 class — is invisible to this file and is pinned
by tests/vectors/ instead. The two guards are complements.
