"""Reputation (0094): peer ±1 on four fixed axes, per-channel scores that
sum to the hub score, leaderboards at both levels, full attribution.

The anti-gaming contract under test: identity-bound votes (auth is the
rater), ONE live vote per (rater, target, axis, channel) with
revision-in-place (never stacking), self-votes refused, membership required
on both sides, notes bounded, archived channels read-only, and the audit
surface (votes-for) naming who stands where on whom.
